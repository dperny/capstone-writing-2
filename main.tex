\begin{abstract}
This paper discusses the ethical problem of software engineers developing
software for use in government mass surveillance. Since NSA contractor Edward
Snowden leaked documents revealing the extent of US government surveillance in
2013, software developers have been discussing their professional and ethical
obligation to oppose mass surveillance. This paper discusses the underlying
technology that powers mass surveillance, the general ethical arguments for and
against, and programmer's responsibilities when confronted with mass
surveillance.

\section{Introduction}
In June of 2013, NSA contractor Edward Snowden obtained and leaked a large
number of classified documents, in part detailing, among other things,
unconstitutional mass-surveillance programs conducted by the NSA. These
programs collect and mine data on an unprecedented scale in an attempt to
discover and terminate terrorist plots before they happen. However, there was
widespread backlash among civil liberties advocates, who argue that mass
surveillance infringes upon the right to privacy and stiffles the liberal
democracy it attempts to uphold. In the wake of the leaks, discussion ignited
among computer science professionals about their ethical responsibilities
toward such programs. 

\section{What is Surveillance}
For a comprehensive understanding of the ethical issues of surveillance, we
first have to understand what mass surveillance is, what it's used for and the
technology that

Surveillance is 
Privacy International defines "Mass Surveillance" as "... the subjection of a
population or significant component of a group to indiscriminate monitoring"
\cite{website:privint}. In other words, mass surveillance is monitoring
everybody.

Technology for mass surveillance takes many names, but perhaps the most
infamous is the NSA program codenamed PRISM. PRISM, one of the first top secret
surveillance programs exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden in June 2013, is
a program to collect massive amounts of bulk data from major internet service
providers. 

\section{Ethics of Surveillance}
As outlined in the previous section, mass surveillance is a powerful tool.
However, like most powerful tools, its use can come with cost. The fear of
surveillance and the importance of privacy have historically. However, as
Richards mentions in his essay "The Dangers of Surveillance,"\cite{richards} 
we often find it hard to pin down exactly what harm surveillance does us.

Richards mentions that we draw much of our distrust from literary tales like
Orwell's 1984, but admits that even the most ardent critics do not consider NSA
programs analogous to Orwell's Big Brother. Instead, he presents two angles
from which surveillance does harm. 

The first angle is that surveillance constitutes a violation of intellectual
privacy. Richards argues that intellectual privacy, -- that is, feeling that
our thoughts are not being monitored -- is important because the lack of
privacy drives us to avoid behaviors that might be considered deviant or
undesirable.

The second angle is that surveillance, at its core, is about power over those
being watched. Surveillance is always for a purpose, and many purposes are less
than benign. For example, Richards points to the case of Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., who was blackmailed over marital indiscretions discovered in the course of
FBI surveillance programs. He also points to the case of World War II, when
census records were unsealed and used to intern Japanese- and German-Americans.



\section{Responsibility of the Programmer}
The Association for Computing Machinery, a professional organization for
computing professionals, addresses the issue of privacy in its Code of
Ethics \cite{ethics}, in section 1.7, "Respect the privacy of others." In it,
ACM instructs members to collect the minimum amount of data, adhere to strict
data collection policies, and treat user data with the "...strictest
confidentiality, except in cases where it is evidence for violation of law...".
It is unclear whether or not the ACM Code of Ethics permits collection of data
for government authorities.

Many programmers argue that this collection is unethical. For example, Rogway
argues in his Statement of Condemnation \cite{rogway} that "Mass surveillance
is intimidating, abuse-prone, and anti-democratic." This seems to put burden on
the programmer
